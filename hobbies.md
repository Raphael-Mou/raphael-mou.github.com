# Hobbies

## Enjoy The Sea

I really love the sea, especially beautiful and clean one. Actually I go to beach during summer than in winter. Many people never think of going to beach during winter but I like to go there at that time. My hometown is a coastal city, so I have lots of fun about the sea. Sometimes I go to beach with my friends, sometimes with my family. I really enjoy many amazing things like fishing, outdoor BBQ, playing with starfish or little crab or other funny sea creature, playing beach ball, etc. on the sea.

## Enjoy Music

When I were a little boy I really think I am good at singing, because My parents are always just like: "Err... What a great singer you are!" cause, you know. Now, I realize that my singing is reaaaaly awful! But I enjoy music, especially folk rock indeed. Sometimes on the weekends my friends and I would like go to bars and enjoy the performance of singers. One of my good friends Jee Guo is a very good singer and his voice is really amazing. 

## Enjoy Creative Stuff

I love creative stuff and unusual ideas, especially some creative artistic expression like ["I AM THE NEW CREATIVE"], [Kwanchai Moriya]'s work, [Victor Vasilev]'s Kub Basin, etc.
