    Depending on where you are, I can implement <strong>agile</strong> (Scrum)
    and <strong>best practices</strong> (<acronym title="Test-Driven Development">TDD</acronym>, Continous Integration) in your existing team or contractors. This is very important especially if you
    are feeling lost, not knowing who's doing what, and when features will be released.

  <p>
  My research interests include deep learning, image/video classification, and image/video parsing.
