    My name is <a href="/"><span itemprop="name">Lichao Mou</span></a>. Since 2012, I have been studying for my master's degree at Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL), <a href="http://english.ucas.ac.cn/Pages/default.aspx"><strong>University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</strong></a>. My advisor is Prof. Xuelong Li, IEEE Fellow. I completed my bachelor's degree in automation at <a href="http://www.xiyou.edu.cn/english.htm"><strong>Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications</strong></a> and am currently enrolled in the third year of Master in Signal and Information Processing. <!--<strong itemprop="role">interim CTO</strong>.--><!--  in <span itemprop="location">Paris</span>. -->

  <p>
    Hey, I'm recently working on my new deep learning algorithm, Non-parametric Bayesian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolution Neural Network</a>, the characteristics are as follows:  <!--<strong itemprop="role">interim CTO</strong>.--><!--  in <span itemprop="location">Paris</span>. -->
  </p>
  
  <p>
      1. Unsupervised learning; <br />
      2. Easy to train and to adapt to different data and tasks; <br />
      3. Data-adapting convolutional parameters are learned by non-parametric Bayesian inference.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now I've finished most of the works, and I'm debugging the code, hope I can release a demo as soon as possible.
